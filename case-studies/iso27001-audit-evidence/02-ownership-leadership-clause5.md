# Clause 5 — Leadership (Ownership & Accountability)

## Clause Intent (Plain Language)

ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 5 asks:

> Who is responsible, and who commits to making governance real?

Security and governance cannot exist without:

- management commitment  
- defined roles  
- clear ownership of controls  

A control without an owner is a control that does not exist.

## Leadership Model in Project F

Project F demonstrates leadership through explicit ownership assignments across the reliability lifecycle:

- producers own upstream correctness  
- reliability owners own governance controls  
- consumers confirm business impact  

This ensures accountability is embedded operationally.

---

## Control Ownership Principle

Project F enforces the rule:

> No owner → no routing → no governance.

This is implemented through:

- alert payload owner_contact requirements (F3)  
- incident escalation paths (F4)  
- contract responsibility boundaries (F5)

---

## Evidence of Clause 5 Leadership

Clause 5 evidence is represented by:

- defined lifecycle ownership model (F1)  
- monitoring routing and escalation roles (F3)  
- incident response accountability (F4)

---

## Key Clause 5 Takeaway

> Governance is a leadership system, not a technical artifact.

Project F demonstrates Clause 5 by making reliability controls owned, accountable, and operational.
