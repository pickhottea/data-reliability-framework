# Clause 9 — Performance Evaluation (Monitoring, Review & Audit Evidence)

## Clause Intent (Plain Language)

ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 9 asks:

> How do we know the governance controls are working?

A control is not real unless it is evaluated.

Clause 9 requires:

- monitoring of control effectiveness  
- measurable evidence  
- internal review and audit readiness  
- management-level evaluation  

---

## Performance Evaluation in Project F

Project F treats reliability governance as operational controls.

Clause 9 is demonstrated through:

- continuous monitoring signals  
- alert escalation workflows  
- evidence preservation for audit review  
- traceability across lineage context  

Project F proves that governance is active, not theoretical.

---

## Monitoring as Control Effectiveness Proof (F3)

Project F defines monitoring not as metrics, but as evidence.

Controls are evaluated through:

- freshness SLA alerts  
- schema drift detection  
- data quality rule failures  
- severity-based escalation routing  

Monitoring outputs always include audit-required context:

- dataset name  
- rule ID  
- severity  
- owner contact  
- contract version  
- lineage reference  
- runbook link  

This satisfies Clause 9’s requirement for measurable governance evidence.

---

## Internal Review Cycle (Governance Continuity)

Clause 9 requires that monitoring is reviewed systematically.

Project F defines required review cycles:

- weekly threshold and anomaly review  
- post-incident adjustment of controls  
- quarterly governance evidence audit  

Reliability controls must evolve based on observed failures.

---

## Audit Evidence Sources

Clause 9 evidence is produced directly by Project F artifacts:

- F2 — Data Quality Rules (control execution results)  
- F3 — Monitoring & Alerts (detection evidence)  
- F4 — Incident Response Playbook (corrective workflows)  
- F6 — Metadata & Lineage Evidence (traceable audit context)  

Governance evidence is operationally generated, not manually created.

---

## Management Review Alignment (Enterprise Readiness)

Clause 9 also requires management-level evaluation:

- Are controls effective?
- Are risks changing?
- Are incidents increasing?
- Is governance evidence complete?

Project F enables this through:

- searchable observability evidence (Project 2 extension: ELK)
- structured incident escalation records
- traceable lineage continuity across environments

This provides decision-ready governance oversight.

---

## Key Clause 9 Takeaway

> Monitoring is not optional.  
> Monitoring is the system that proves governance controls exist in operation.

Project F demonstrates Clause 9 through:

- reliability monitoring  
- escalation evidence  
- audit-ready traceability  
- continuous governance review
