# Clause 10 — Improvement (Corrective Action & Continuous Governance)

## Clause Intent (Plain Language)

ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 10 asks:

> When something fails, how do we improve the system so it does not fail again?

Governance is not static.

Clause 10 requires:

- nonconformity detection  
- corrective action  
- continuous improvement of controls  

---

## Improvement Loop in Project F

Project F operationalizes improvement through an evidence-driven reliability cycle:

- failures are detected by monitoring (F3)  
- incidents trigger accountable response (F4)  
- root causes are traced via lineage context (F6)  
- controls are updated through rules and contracts (F2, F5)  

This ensures governance evolves based on real operational outcomes.

---

## Nonconformity Handling

A governance failure may include:

- schema drift  
- critical data quality violation  
- freshness SLA breach  
- missing ownership or routing  

These are treated as nonconformities requiring corrective action.

---

## Corrective Action Evidence

Project F defines corrective action as:

- updating quality rules (F2)  
- revising alert thresholds (F3)  
- improving escalation playbooks (F4)  
- versioning contracts for stability (F5)  
- strengthening metadata traceability (F6)  

Each corrective action produces new governance evidence.

---

## Continuous Governance Principle

> Reliability controls are only meaningful if they improve over time.

Clause 10 is satisfied when:

- failures lead to control refinement  
- evidence is preserved for audit  
- governance becomes stronger after incidents  

---

## Key Clause 10 Takeaway

> Continuous improvement is the final proof that governance is alive.

Project F demonstrates Clause 10 through:

- operational corrective workflows  
- traceable evidence loops  
- evolving reliability controls
