# Clause 7 — Support (Documentation, Awareness & Capability)

## Clause Intent (Plain Language)

ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 7 asks:

> Do we have the people, documentation, and support structure to operate governance?

Controls require support:

- competence and awareness  
- documented procedures  
- evidence preservation  
- communication of responsibilities  

---

## Support Structure in Project F

Project F demonstrates Clause 7 through governance-ready documentation:

- lifecycle backbone (F1)  
- quality rules catalog (F2)  
- monitoring specification (F3)  
- incident response playbooks (F4)  
- contracts and lineage evidence (F5–F6)

These artifacts form an operational governance knowledge base.

## Documentation as Governance Evidence

Clause 7 requires that governance is not tribal knowledge.

Project F ensures documentation exists for:

- what controls are applied  
- who owns them  
- how failures are escalated  
- where audit evidence is stored  

---

## Competence & Awareness Alignment

Project F makes reliability actionable by ensuring:

- alerts include ownership + runbook links  
- incidents follow structured workflows  
- evidence is reviewable and repeatable  

Governance controls are usable, not theoretical.

## Key Clause 7 Takeaway

> A control that cannot be understood or operated is not a control.

Project F demonstrates Clause 7 through structured documentation and operational readiness.
