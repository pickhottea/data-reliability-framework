# Clause 8 — Operation (Operational Control Execution)

## Clause Intent (Plain Language)

ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 8 asks:

> Are the controls actually running in daily operation?

Governance is not a document.

Clause 8 requires that controls are executed operationally:

- monitoring runs continuously  
- quality rules are applied  
- incidents trigger response  
- evidence is generated in practice  

---

## Operational Execution in Project F

Project F demonstrates Clause 8 through active reliability control operation:

- ingestion validation  
- rule-based quality enforcement (F2)  
- monitoring and alert escalation (F3)  
- incident handling workflows (F4)  
- metadata and lineage traceability (F6)

Controls are implemented as operational governance loops.

---

## Evidence-Producing Operations

Clause 8 is satisfied because Project F produces:

- monitoring alerts with severity routing  
- tickets linked to runbooks  
- lineage context attached to failures  
- contract versions referenced during incidents  

This ensures controls exist beyond paper.

---

## Operational Governance Principle

> Paper compliance is not operation.  
> Evidence-producing execution is operation.

Project F demonstrates operational governance by treating reliability as a running control system.

---

## Key Clause 8 Takeaway

> Clause 8 proves governance is alive.

Project F demonstrates Clause 8 through controls that operate, escalate, and generate audit evidence continuously.
