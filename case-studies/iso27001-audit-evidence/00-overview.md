# ISO 27001 Audit Evidence Pack (Project D Extension)

## Purpose

This case study demonstrates how **data reliability controls** can generate
**ISO/IEC 27001-aligned audit evidence**.

Instead of treating governance as documentation, Project F produces operational proof:

- quality controls
- monitoring signals
- incident response workflows
- metadata and lineage traceability

This extension maps those artifacts into ISO Clause 4–10 structure.

## What This Pack Demonstrates

This evidence pack shows how reliability governance supports:

- scope and ownership clarity  
- risk-based control selection  
- operational execution  
- monitoring and review evidence  
- continuous improvement

## ISO Clause Mapping Files

This folder contains one file per clause:

- Clause 4 — Scope & Context  
- Clause 5 — Leadership & Ownership  
- Clause 6 — Risk Planning & Controls

## Key Principle

> Audit readiness is not paperwork.  
> Audit readiness is evidence produced by operational governance.

Project F provides a practical example of this principle.
